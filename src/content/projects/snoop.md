A CLI tool built in Go using the Cobra framework that enables seamless file sharing between devices on the same network by creating an HTTP server with a web interface for file browsing. The tool eliminates the need for USB drives or cloud storage for local file transfers, allowing users to navigate to any directory, start the server with configurable port settings, and access files from any network-connected device through a web browser with simple click-to-download functionality.
