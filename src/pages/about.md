Hi, I'm Deepraj Baidya also known as **infamous**, **deepraj02** on the Internet, currently living in [Dehradun](https://www.google.com/search?q=dehradun&sca_esv=7d5ca3be01585382&sxsrf=ADLYWIJ5QKIRsWz1eNgWot4Plln-j7jS8Q%3A1730460036472&ei=hLkkZ4TFHPuVseMP3MqY2Qg&ved=0ahUKEwiEl5b-gbuJAxX7SmwGHVwlJosQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=dehradun&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCGRlaHJhZHVuMgQQIxgnMg0QLhiABBixAxhDGIoFMgoQABiABBgUGIcCMggQABiABBixAzIFEAAYgAQyCBAAGIAEGLEDMggQABiABBixAzIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAjIIEAAYgAQYsQMyBRAAGIAESKMKUMIDWMIDcAF4AZABAJgB-wGgAfsBqgEDMi0xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAICoAKJAsICChAAGLADGNYEGEeYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwUxLjAuMaAH4gg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) doing my Bachelor's.

My journey into tech started back in high school when I first got my hands dirty with [Python](https://python.org), creating desktop applications using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [PyQt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/).

That initial spark of curiosity about how apps and websites work has grown into a full-blown passion for technology. 

A big Advocate for Open-Source and free/libre softwares.

I also Organise [Meetups](https://forum.fossunited.org/t/foss-meetups-dehradun-2024/2912) in Dehradun (almost every month), mostly focused on FOSS and OpenSource, with collaboration with 
[FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/c/dehradun).
